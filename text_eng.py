Haha!", "204": "Well, sooner or later, it was going to happen. Doesn't matter who does it!", "205": "You can thank me later! Hahaha!", "206": "There will be an Arena Portal opening up soon on your island, so keep your eye out for that.", "207": "Also, I have a small favor to ask of you.\nI'm sure you're familiar with the Garen Forest nearby.", "208": "There seems to be a sudden outbreak of monsters in the Garen Forest. Can you find out what's going on?", "209": "The Council of Magicians are investigating...and it's taking time. We're...busy here.", "210": "Don't be afraid, they're just forest monsters, so it'll be good practice.

What is that? A giant wolf?", "269": "Watch out!", "270": "Phew, I thought that was the end, but you saved us both!", "271": "Where'd this giant monster come from?", "272": "That was a summoned monster that protects the sanctuary.", "273": "..Who are you?", "274": "Everything's gone to chaos...", "275": "I'm Lycana from the Magic Society of the Council.\nI'm the one who requested help.", "276": "Then I suppose you could tell us what happened here?", "277": "He's long since been forgotten, but the ancient hero Dyren was buried at the deepest end of the Garen Forest.", "278": "However, the sanctuary was destroyed by someone recently and we don't know why.", "279": "I came here after hearing the bad news and ran into the guardians of the sanctuary.", "280": "My god..\nSo the whole forest was trying to guard the sanctuary?", "281": "That's right.\nBut with you two here, the whole place is in fury.", "282": "We need to get out of here.\nThe guardian will return soon.", "283": "Yikes, not that giant wolf again!", "284": "Let's get out of here now, we'll talk about the details later!", "301": "We got a message from Durand. \nDid he hear about the Garen Forest?", "302": "Dear friend,\nI heard you had a match with an ancient monster.", "303": "Finally, a real match, right?\nHope it wasn't too dangerous. Haha!", "304": "Well, I was shocked, too. \nThey told me it'd be a simple job!", "305": "Anyway, it looks like you met Lycana.", "306": "The Council thinks that it's a simple heist...but I heard the whole forest was in a rage.", "307": "Lycana is looking into the situation, but we don't have any answers yet.", "308": "Putting that aside, let's get to work.", "309": "The portal should be open by now...", "310": "Portal...?", "311": "Look over there!", "312": "Hey, the Arena Portal is open!", "313": "Fascinating, isn't it?\nNow, this is where you come in.", "314": "Welcome to the Arena, my friend!", "315": "It's finally starting! How exciting!", "316": "Alright, now it's time to choose our match.", "317": "Actually... I've already chosen your first opponent for you.", "318": "They call him Gready.\nThe guy used to steal and rob during the war.", "319": "He might be a bit much for your first match...", "320": "but I'm sure you can handle him, right? Hahaha!", "321": "Now, what are you waiting for?", "322": "I'll be looking forward to your victory!", "323": "I knew that he could be random, but wow!", "324": "He can be really unpredictable sometimes.", "325": "Well, I guess this is it. \nI've got butterflies in my stomach already.", "401": "There's a message from the Council.\nWho could it be?", "402": "Hello, this is Lycana.\nI wanted to thank you again for last time.", "403": "I'm still looking into the case, but...\nit's hard to find evidence.", "404": "I was wondering if you could fulfill a request from the Council.", "405": "Recently, ancient ruins were discovered on Mt. Siz, and there have been reports of Giants' appearances.", "406": "It's not surprising that monsters are stirred by the ancient ruins' mysterious power, but Giants?", "407": "The Council usually looks into these matters, but they're busy with the Arena.", "408": "I'm worried that this is too urgent of a matter to be ignored.", "409": "I can promise you that you will be rewarded handsomely.", "410": "Durand has praised you as a great Summoner, and I've seen your abilities with my own eyes.", "411": "I know this may sound difficult, but please consider our favor.", "412": "Let's keep in touch. Thank you.", "413": "Lycana is in charge of ancient ruins and relics in the magic society.", "414": "It sounds like a promising opportunity!", "415": "But Giants, eh? They're hard to come by in the entire continent.", "416": "Is this gonna get us killed again? I hope not!", "451": "Monsters in the ruins...!?\nCould they be attracted by the power of the ruins like Lycana said?", "452": "Phew, that was close!\nThe Council must be extremely busy.", "453": "I heard it's been a while since the ruins were discovered, and they've just been left untouched!", "454": "The monsters are already attacking... I have a bad feeling this investigation isn't going to be easy.", "458": "Monsters all over the place!\nThere's gotta be something other than the ruins that's attracting them.", "459": "Where are those Giants anyway? There's only monsters here.", "460": "We're already on the 3rd level, too.\nThis is so strange.", "461": "Huh? Is that a Golem?\nWhat's it doing here?", "462": "Now I can see some truth behind the rumors. \nBut Golems? Come on now.", "463": "Golems are usually guardians. \nThey're not the type of monsters that just walk around.", "464": "For the guardians of the ruins to wake up and move around? That makes no sense!", "465": "There's something about these ruins.", "466": "Golems again! And lots more, this time!", "467": "Wow, that was close!\nHow could there be so many guardians?", "468": "There's gotta be something precious in these ruins. Otherwise this many Golems would be overkill!", "469": "What could possibly be here?\nAnd how did they all revive themselves?", "470": "Ugh, Golem after Golem... they're like a Golem army!", "471": "Whoa, that's a huge Golem!", "472": "Watch out!", "473": "That was terrifying!\nI never dreamed there'd be a Golem that big.", "474": "I never wanna see another Golem again in my life!", "475": "What could those Golems be protecting here? I don't see anything…", "476": "Hey, this part is destroyed.", "477": "I don't think we're the first ones to set foot in here.\nThis was recently destroyed.", "478": "Does that mean someone already came and looted the place? More thieves?", "479": "So something must have woken up the guardians from their slumber...\nThere's something funny going on here.", "480": "We should let Lycana know.", "501": "There's a message from Lycana. \nIt's probably about the Mt. Siz ruins.", "502": "Let's take a look at it.", "503": "First, I'd like to thank you for your dedication to the mission.", "504": "I'm shocked about the ruins as much as you are. And all those Golems…", "505": "As you may have suspected, there's a high possibility that there was something precious deep in the ruins.", "506": "It's devastating to think that someone could have broken in to steal precious heritage.", "507": "The Council believes it was the work of treasure hunters, but…", "508": "I have a feeling that it's something else. \nSomeone could have awakened the ruins on purpose.", "509": "It's actually happened before.", "510": "So I ask of you...Could you please check one more place in the ruins?", "511": "The Kabir Ruins which are east of Mt. Siz were already searched a long time ago, but there's been a monster invasion recently.", "512": "I have a feeling the Kabir Ruins could have been disturbed, too.", "513": "Oh, I almost forgot. \nThe council will be supporting you with Mystical Scrolls.", "514": "Please consider these as a gift for your future performance.", "515": "Please, you're my only hope.", "516": "Thank you for your help!", "517": "I've also heard of how ancient ruins can react to some relics.", "518": "But most stay undisturbed because the relics have been missing for centuries.", "519": "The Kabir Ruins... I hope we can get out of it alive!", "700": "Great job!\nI knew you'd win!", "701": "It's a message from Durand.\nWas he really watching the Arena the whole time?", "702": "Let's see what he wrote!", "703": "That was a sweet victory!\nLooks like I could have picked a tougher opponent for you! Haha!", "704": "More important matches will be added to the Competitors' List in the Arena menu.", "705": "The Arena's “Winner takes all” rule is simple, and rather primitive.", "706": "You can consider the Arena as a mini-magic war.", "707": "But, this is the only way to keep peace for now.", "708": "You do remember that we all want checks and balances, right?", "709": "…But personally, what do I really want?\nFor you win it all, and take it all!", "710": "I'm serious.\nBecause I think that's the best option. Hahaha!", "711": "Oh! Check your Inbox, I've sent you a gift to help you fight!", "712": "I'll be waiting for the good news, then!", "713": "Hmph, it's all politics!\nI do think there's one good thing about the Arena.", "714": "You can punish bad Magicians!", "715": "Gready had a bad reputation for being an evil, no-good scumbag.", "716": "It felt so good to see him lose like that!", "717": "I'm looking forward to more matches!", "718": "Oh, I almost forgot!\nWe need to set up our defense!", "719": "Now that we're participating in the Arena,\nwe need to have monsters to defend our territory.", "720": "Let's place monsters to defend the Arena from the Summoner's Tower.", "721": "Great.\nWe're all ready now!", "722": "All we have to do is win!", "723": "I know you can do it!\nI'll help you as much as I can, too!", "724": "But you should be careful. Powerful summoners are waiting to take you down.", "901": "Hmm? A message from the Arena channel.\nIt's not from Durand... who could it be?", "902": "Hello. I heard you're the rising star of the Arena these days. I'm the Summoner Morgana.", "903": "I hear rumors about you and me being the dark horses.", "904": "I'm a little offended to be compared to a country summoner that I've never heard of, actually.", "905": "Let's stop the unpleasant rumors by having a fair and square match.", "906": "You wouldn't run away, would you?\nI'll see you at the Arena soon.", "907": "Oh, it's her...\nShe's one of the most popular summoners these days!", "908": "She's incredibly powerful and beautiful, that's why people love her!", "909": "She's won multiple battles in a row at the Arena! I admire her and envy her at the same time.", "910": "Looks like she's got something against you though.", "1001": "Now for Durand's message. What could this be about?", "1002": "Hey, friend! Busy?\nEllia told me things have been really hectic there.", "1003": "I heard you're training for the Arena and also helping out the Council. I feel somewhat at fault for bestowing all this responsibility on you!", "1004": "Don't forget to take some time to yourself while you work.", "1005": "How about a breather? \nA trip somewhere, maybe?", "1006": "Do you remember our trip to Ragon?\nThe beautiful White Mountains... Ah, it was stunning!", "1007": "Yeah, let's do it!\nThe chilly weather's perfect for it.", "1008": "I happen to know someone there.\nHis name is Taihan, the best summoner in Ragon.", "1009": "Good. Send my regards for me.\nHave a good trip!", "1010": "I would give anything to be able to go with you!", "1011": "Talk to me when you get back!", "1012": "...What?!", "1013": "Does that mean we're going!?", "1014": "Sigh... Durand is always like that.", "1015": "I guess we can think of it as a vacation.", "1051": "Ugh, who are these guys?", "1052": "My name is Taihan, one of the guardians of the White Mountain.\nAre you the one Durand talked about?", "1053": "Oh, hello, Taihan. Nice to...", "1054": "So it's you. Let's see now.", "1055": "Hmm? See what?", "1056": "If you can get through my monsters and reach the peak of the White Mountain, I'll acknowledge your skills a bit.", "1057": "Huh? Taihan, what are you talking about?", "1058": "Let's begin.", "1059": "Ahhhh, the monsters are coming!", "1060": "So Durand wasn't bluffing.\nHaven't met a worthy match in a while.", "1061": "You'll have to do your best from now, though.", "1062": "I'll be waiting at the peak.", "1063": "I think there's a misunderstanding here, Taihan.\nTaihan?", "1064": "He's gone...?\nWhat the hell was that?", "1065": "There's something wrong.\nWe should find him before we're too late.", "1066": "Damn it! Taihan must have let his monsters loose. \nWe're going to be late...", "1067": "The best summoner in Ragon?\nLooks like he's pretty worthy of that title.", "1068": "Are we really gonna go to the peak?", "1069": "Ugh, more monsters!", "1070": "That means we'll have to get to the peak ourselves!", "1071": "What kind of a vacation is this!?", "1072": "This is just endless!\nI think I've seen enough White Mountain monsters.", "1073": "I was imagining beautiful sceneries and hot springs…", "1074": "Achoo! It's getting colder and colder the higher up we go.", "1075": "Aren't you cold? I feel like I'm freezing over here! Shoulda worn more layers…", "1076": "Finally, we've reached the peak!\nWhere's Taihan?", "1077": "Taihan! Taaaaihaaaan!", "1078": "Ahhh! What's that giant bird?", "1079": "You made it…", "1080": "Wait, that was Taihan's monster?", "1081": "This is my treat to you as the guardian of the White Mountain!", "1082": "Okay, that's good enough!\nI'm quite surprised by your skills.", "1083": "Taihan! Why are you attacking us?", "1084": "Quiet, kid! I'm talking to your Lord!", "1085": "The Council has proven its power.\nI can now hand the Mana Crystal Mine over now.", "1086": "Tell Durand that the treaty is valid.", "1087": "Huh? Mine? Treaty?", "1088": "But remember. We'll keep watching.\nThe power must be used correctly.", "1089": "No...Taihan, what does that...", "1090": "I'm done talking.", "1091": "Also, you're quite good.\nI'll see you 'round.", "1092": "Huh? Taihan! Taaaihaaaan!", "1093": "...He disappeared.\nWhat in the world...?", "1094": "...Grr... this isn't a misunderstanding!\nI think Durand used us!", "1095": "Let's go back now! \nI'll teach him a lesson!", "1101": "...Ha. A message from Durand.", "1102": "Hey, how's the trip?\nEventful, I presume? Haha!", "1103": "Now, now. A trip is a trip.\nIt's unpredictable! Full of adventures!", "1104": "I know Taihan wasn't an easy match, but I thought you'd be good enough.", "1105": "I also wanted you to make some good memories!", "1106": "This is unbelievable!", "1107": "This is a little late, but there's a small Mana Crystal Mine on the Ragon White Mountain.", "1108": "You see, the guardians there have a reputation for being tough. That's why we had a little conflict.", "1109": "Well, the treaty was going to be approved anyway, so I think it's a win-win situation!", "1110": "You did a great job! The Council and I are truly grateful, my friend!", "1111": "You know, I really think he should have said something before.", "1112": "Oh, there's some good news.", "1113": "The guy you were looking for... We found some leads!", "1114": "Yes, Sir Kazan!", "1115": "Sir Kazan? The legendary summoner?", "1116": "I've worked very hard to find him for you. I went through so many hardships... (omitted)...", "1117": "...(omitted)...and so I crossed over the mountains...(omitted)...", "1118": "...(omitted)...and he wasn't there! So I...(omitted)...", "1119": "Grr... so where was he?!", "1120": "...(omitted)...and that's how I found him.\nOh, it was very tiring and a lot of work.", "1121": "Haha...should I tell you or not?", "1122": "Sir Kazan is in the Telain Forest.\nYou should leave soon. Who knows where he'll go next.", "1123": "I can see you're getting excited over there! Hahaha!\nWell, good luck!", "1124": "Telain Forest is known for its deep jungles.\nOf course he would hide in such a place.", "1125": "I grew up listening to stories about Sir Kazan! My heart's pounding right now.", "1126": "Let's go to Telain right this moment!", "1201": "Oh! It's a message from Durand.", "1202": "I'll open it.", "1203": "Hahahaha! Hahahahaha!\nWahahahahahahahahaha!", "1204": "...Huh?!", "1205": "Hahaahahaha!\nHaha...hahaha", "1206": "...Durand?", "1207": "Ahem! I was just expressing my feelings. You should see this with Ellia, too.", "1208": "Heh...\nA summoner named Edmund has challenged you.", "1209": "Oh...", "1210": "Well, there's just one thing...Haha!", "1211": "He wants Ellia if he wins the battle.\nHahahaha!", "1212": "...Grrrrr…", "1213": "Well, Ellia's got plenty of suitors, but Edmund's been chasing her for years!", "1214": "Hey, Ellia! Edmund's not bad.\nHe comes from a good family and he's got the elite course education!", "1215": "Well... I guess you can hear the rest from Ellia.", "1216": "Do you know how many times I've said no? NO!", "1217": "You gotta win this match.\nI'll never forgive you if you lose!", "1301": "This is gonna be a tough trip.\nDo you really think Sir Kazan is here?", "1302": "Whoa. That came out of nowhere.", "1303": "Hahaha…Interesting.\nAre you the one Durand sent?", "1304": "Who are you? Do you know Durand?\nWe've come to look for Sir Kazan.", "1305": "Haha...Right. Now, let's see if you can prove that you're smarter than Kazan.", "1306": "What? Smarter than Kazan? Who?", "1307": "Don't let me down!", "1308": "What do you mean?\nHey!", "1309": "He disappeared...", "1310": "I feel like I've been through this before.", "1311": "Wait…It can't be…", "1312": "Monsters again!", "1313": "So it's you guys! Grandpa was talking about you guys.", "1314": "Hmm? Who are you?\nWait...did you summon these beasts?", "1315": "Bring it on.\nI'm not gonna go easy on you!", "1316": "Ahh! The monsters!", "1317": "Ahahaha! You're pretty good.\nThis is gonna be so much fun!", "1318": "Who are you? Is Sir Kazan your Grandpa?", "1319": "Maybe? Hehehe!", "1320": "Come up to the North if you can! Hehe.", "1321": "I'll show you something fun if you come!", "1322": "Huh? Hey, stop right there!", "1323": "Ah. She's gone.", "1324": "…They never listen…", "1325": "It's like déjà vu!", "1326": "...The monsters are blocking the way. That means we gotta fight our way through, right?", "1327": "It's just like I expected. Sigh... how deep is the jungle?", "1328": "They're so aggressive and we're only just beginning...", "1329": "So how much do we have left until we reach the North? I see trees in every direction and it's not helping.", "1330": "What's Durand up to now?\nI'm really gonna give him a piece of my mind when I get back!", "1331": "Monsters again... Where is that kid anyway?", "1332": "Those are some strong summonings. She looked younger than me but her magic skills are impressive.", "1333": "She's probably Sir Kazan's apprentice.", "1334": "If we can find her, finding Sir Kazan would be easy. But this jungle is just endless and it's way too hot in here!", "1335": "Different monsters. Why do we always need to go through them?", "1336": "Did you know we always go forward 7 times?", "1337": "...Honestly, we can just have a match when we see each other for the first time. Don't you agree?", "1340": "I think we're almost at the end of the North and according to Durand, the monster…", "1341": "wouldn't come out now. Would it? Haha…", "1342": "Whoa! A Chimera! See? I told you it would come out here.", "1343": "Say hi to my friend Lagmaron!", "1344": "So you even know how to control Chimeras?", "1345": "Are you ready for some fun? Hehehe... let's go!", "1346": "Whoa, hang on now!", "1347": "That was a surprise. You guys are strong!", "1348": "Grandpa, these guys are fun!", "1349": "That's enough, now tell me! Is your Grandpa Sir Kazan?", "1350": "Hahahaha! You beat my granddaughter... that means there are still some decent magicians out there.", "1351": "Are you...Sir Kazan?", "1352": "I am the one they call Kazan! Hahaha! Looks like Durand didn't let me down!", "1353": "What did Durand say? We just came here to see you.", "1354": "Huh? So you don't even know why you're here? Wahahaha! That is…amusing. Hahaha!", "1355": "Tell Durand that he won the bet. Ahaha!", "1356": "And you. You're the genius who can defeat Kazan, I presume?", "1357": "Whoa, Durand was just joking! Please don't get upset.", "1358": "We'll have to see about that. You both are funny... Durand and you...", "1359": "Sir Kazan, please show yourself. We've come all the way here.", "1360": "Haha... Perhaps one day. But not today.", "1361": "Grandpa is a mystical person. You should know that.", "1362": "Shai, come back now.", "1363": "I was told the best one doesn't show oneself. Hehe!", "1364": "Shai, come over here!", "1365": "That was fun! Let's do it again. Bye now!", "1366": "Huh? B...bye!", "1367": "Oh, I'm so confused...", "1368": "Anyway, Duraaaand!", "1401": "You have two messages. The first one is from...Durand.", "1402": "Fine, let's see what he has to say.", "1403": "I got the message from Sir Kazan. Good job, friend!", "1404": "Probably pulling your hair out there... Hey by now, you should be used to it! Hahaha!", "1405": "I actually needed Sir Kazan for the Arena. I've visited him many times but he's very crabby.", "1406": "So I made a bet with him with a little white lie. See, he's very curious! Haha!", "1407": "\"The genius magician, more powerful than the likes of Kazan.\" That was very irresponsible of me.", "1408": "But I think he really enjoyed it! He sent Shai to the Arena!", "1409": "I guess it's a win-win situation then. You admired him and now he likes you!", "1410": "Oh, and I think she chose you for the first match. She seemed enthused.", "1411": "You've got that special something. You make more friends after every trip!", "1412": "I'll contact you soon with good news, then!", "1413": "No, no, no! Don't contact us! I'll mark it as spam!", "1501": "Did you hear? There's some crazy guy in the Arena.", "1502": "They call him Volta the fiery Magician, because he'll burn anything that comes his way.", "1503": "He doesn't care about whether he wins or loses, he just loves to fight. The Council doesn't know what to do with him.", "1504": "I don't know how such a volatile guy became a summoner. You should teach him a lesson.", "1505": "He'll know what it means to be a real summoner.", "1601": "A message from Durand! Maybe he heard about the Hydeni Ruins incident.", "1602": "I think the Council is busy trying to figure it out. Durand must be busy, too.", "1603": "I'll open the message for you.", "1604": "Hello, old friend...or should I say my problem solver?", "1605": "The mysterious summoner in black has moved the ruins! I smell a conspiracy..hahah!", "1606": "I don't know how he can joke around at a time like this!", "1607": "But don't you worry. Because I, Durand, have started on my work!", "1608": "I can already feel it! Summoners in black, right?", "1609": "We have some work to do because of a disturbance in the Council.", "1610": "An emergency situation has broken out in the Tamor Desert and I don't have enough men to send over there.", "1611": "As you know, the Magic War wreaked havoc on the Tamor Desert.", "1612": "The war is over, but the wild summonings and monsters keep causing trouble!", "1613": "We need to clean up the place, and only you have the skills to do it.", "1614": "I know you'll accept!", "1615": "Of course you will!", "1616": "There's no other way to level-up, is there?", "1617": "I'll leave it up to you then, my friend!", "1618": "Level-up? That was totally out of line!", "1619": "Well I guess by now, our players are sick of reading all this dialogue... Let's get going!", "1651": "More monsters! Geez, they just love us here, don't they.", "1652": "Every one of them wants us dead!", "1653": "I get it, it's so hot and barren here, and the heat would drive anyone crazy!", "1654": "Monsters everywhere! How many more monsters can there be?!", "1655": "I can't tell the difference between wild monsters and native monsters. I feel like it's dangerous everywhere we go.", "1656": "It was once a peaceful trade route...and now it's been torn apart by the war.", "1657": "Why do humans engage in war? I just don't understand.", "1658": "I think they know we're here. The monsters are gathering, careful now!", "1659": "I think the heat is getting to me...", "1660": "I feel like I could fall apart at any moment..", "1661": "Phew, we're at the last point!", "1662": "Let's power through, we're almost there!", "1663": "Argh...Why are there giant monsters every time?", "1664": "Sigh...It's never easy!", "1665": "Phew, that was close!", "1666": "I just hope there's no more accidents for a while...", "1667": "Let's go back for now. I can't take this sweltering desert anymore!", "1701": "An urgent message from Durand!", "1702": "Did something happen?", "1703": "Tzzz...Hey...Tzzz... I hope you get this message.", "1704": "When you get this message, please hurry. The Council is under attack!", "1705": "Ahh! Not the Council!", "1706": "I know, I can't believe it, either.", "1707": "There's always been a lot of opposition against the Arena. The dark summoners were behind the awakening of the ruins, too.", "1708": "I always had my eye on them…but I was too late.", "1709": "I never thought they would attack us like this. We're doing our best to fight back.", "1710": "But there's another problem.", "1711": "The opposition party's attacks are unpredictable. Their forces aren't enough to overthrow the Council.", "1712": "It seems that this attack was nothing more than a distraction...and they were actually after the Relic Storage.", "1713": "We never thought they'd be after the Relic Storage, and not the ruins...\nThey really got us this time.", "1714": "We could probably overpower them soon, but the relic is the problem.", "1715": "You must go to Vrofagus now! The relics...Tzzz!", "1716": "Oh no, the message was cut!", "1717": "Is Durand okay? Who's behind all this?", "1718": "We need to hurry! We can't waste any time!", "1900": "You have two messages. One is from Lycana, and the other is from...Durand.", "1901": "I'll open Lycana's message first. It's probably about the Mt. Siz ruins.", "1902": "I was hoping my predictions would be wrong...", "1903": "These events are definitely connected to each other. How did they get their hands on the relic to awaken the ruins?", "1904": "I have a feeling other ruins will become a target soon...but which one?", "1905": "Thanks to you two, the Council is acting quickly. They're looking to see if the ruins have anything in common.", "1906": "It'll take time, but we'll get to the bottom of this. I thank you again for your cooperation.", "1907": "And one more thing...We have another big request from the Council.", "1908": "I personally was against it because it's too dangerous, but…", "1909": "Have you heard of the Cairos Dungeon?", "1910": "It's the biggest ancient ruins known to man, and the most dangerous place on earth.", "1911": "There's a number of research groups that didn't make it back home…", "1912": "The Cairos Dungeon search is actually open to the public, but those who enter must take full responsibility for themselves.", "1913": "I'm delivering the request from the Council, but I don't recommend you risk yourself too much.", "1914": "I'll contact you if there's any progress.", "1915": "The infamous Cairos Dungeon! It's the point of no return!", "1916": "Lycana is right. Shouldn't we reconsider this?", "1917": "The treasure hunters could have gone to the Cairos Dungeon... Why rob the ruins?", "1951": "I can't believe you got through the Cairos Dungeon! I was really worried.", "1952": "You really know no boundaries!", "1953": "But, remember! The deeper you go in, more dangerous it'll get.", "2001": "A message from Durand. What could it be about?", "2002": "How are you, my friend? Remember that Gready guy?", "2003": "Seems like he was a little shocked after losing to you last time! Well, you really didn't show him any mercy. Hahaha!", "2004": "It looks like Gready's pride took a big hit because he got his boys to challenge you!", "2005": "Now, isn't that entertaining?", "2006": "There's this guy called Razak, in particular... He looked pretty intense.", "2007": "Looks like you messed with the wrong guys, huh? Hahaha!", "2008": "Hey, now, don't look at me like that! You would have faced him in the future anyway!", "2009": "You might as well face him now fair and square, right?", "2010": "Well, I'll be waiting for good news then! Show him who's boss! Yeah!", "2011": "Ugh, I can't believe Durand.", "2012": "It's not that I don't trust him, but he needs to give us more time for us to settle down!", "2013": "Well, there's really one way to solve this. Beat him and show him what you've got!", "2014": "I believe in you!", "2101": "Hmm? A message from someone I've never heard of! Who could it be?", "2102": "How've you been? It's Taihan from the White Mountain.", "2103": "I'll cut right to the chase. As you might have heard, the guardians of White Mountain and the Council signed a treaty.", "2104": "However, that doesn't mean that we support the Council. We just gave them a chance.", "2105": "Like I said, we've been watching, but that wasn't enough.", "2106": "So, I decided to enter the Arena myself to find out what they're up to.", "2107": "And, I choose you for my first match. You probably know why.", "2108": "I hope you're ready, you'll have to be to have a chance against me.", "2109": "I'll see you at the match.", "2110": "He's a real charmer, isn't he?", "2111": "We're not going to just sit here, are we? Let's show him who we are!", "2201": "Ugh, monsters! I hope they were just attracted to the ruins this time.", "2202": "That wasn't too bad!", "2203": "According to Lycana, this is the ruins of the ancient Wind spirits.", "2204": "Lycana predicted a flurry of Wind spirits to appear if the ruins are awake.", "2205": "Looks like things are okay so far.", "2209": "How'd the monsters make it all the way in here?", "2210": "I don't see any Wind spirits, fortunately. But just how many levels are there?", "2211": "The ancient people must have loved digging holes! There's always more underground floors! Gah!", "2215": "Ahh! Wind spirits! Does that mean the ruins are...?", "2216": "Lycana was right! Also, we're underground, but it's still so windy. How??", "2217": "The Kabir Ruins was asleep and the search ended 5 years ago.\nSomeone must have awakened it!", "2218": "Who would do such a thing…and why? The Wind spirits won't be easy to deal with.", "2219": "Wind spirits coming from every direction! Ahh!", "2220": "Endless waves of those spirits... Who did this to the ruins?! Who!", "2221": "Wait, is that...a high Wind spirit?", "2222": "Careful, they're different from the others!", "2223": "Phew, I thought I was going to fly away... Those Wind spirits are no joke.", "2224": "You were amazing, taking on all those Wind spirits! I couldn't even stand still!", "2225": "Anyhow, I think this is our final stop.", "2226": "All the traces have been destroyed by the wind…", "2227": "Lycana was right about the ruins being awakened.", "2228": "What kind of evidence do we have so far?\nThe ruins are awake and scary Wind spirits are attacking us?", "2229": "Sigh... That doesn't help much considering all the work we did.", "2230": "I wonder if whoever awakened the ruins is okay. They must have faced the Wind spirits too, right?", "2231": "Whoever they were, they had to have been as good as you to fight off all the Wind spirits.", "2232": "Let's go back for now. We should talk to Lycana about this.", "2301": "Next, a message from Lycana. Maybe she made some progress with the research!", "2302": "I'll open it right away.", "2303": "I must say, the search took a while.", "2304": "We've narrowed down to a few ruins after the search. We still don't know what their intentions are, though.", "2305": "The Council is going to dispatch research groups to the other ruins. I'd like you two to head to the Hydeni Ruins.", "2306": "Like the Kabir Ruins, they're ruins of spirits. There's no reports of monsters there yet...", "2307": "I think there's a chance we can get ahead of them if we're right.", "2308": "I'll send more details to Ellia.", "2309": "I do apologize for all the trouble, but rest assured you can check for your rewards in the Missions tab.", "2310": "Thank you!", "2311": "I'm glad they're making progress! We gotta catch them in the act!", "2312": "But those spirits... I hope they don't wake up this time!", "2351": "Wait, I thought there weren't gonna be any monsters!", "2352": "Well, those weren't spirits, but I still have a bad feeling about this.", "2353": "According to Lycana, the Hydeni Ruins once belonged to ancient Water spirits.", "2354": "That means if someone awakened it, it could flood and we'll drown!", "2355": "The monsters keep showing up, but they're not spirits.", "2356": "We're already deep inside and I'm a bit disturbed the monsters have made it this far.", "2357": "I'm hearing sounds of a flowing stream... It's just me, right?", "2358": "The Water spirits!", "2359": "It's Murphy's Law. Hmph!", "2360": "Were we one step behind again? We need to catch the guys who keep awakening the ruins!", "2361": "Let's hurry up. There haven't been any reports yet, so maybe they just woke up.", "2362": "More Water spirits!", "2363": "The spirits are getting stronger and stronger.", "2364": "Thump! Thump!", "2365": "What was that? It came from there! Let's hurry!", "2366": "Whoaaaa!", "2367": "Who goes there?", "2368": "It was you who awakened the ruins!", "2369": "The Council sent you guys, eh?", "2370": "You guys aren't treasure hunters... Why are you awakening the ruins? And what are you stealing?", "2371": "Awaken the ruins, you say? That's funny.", "2372": "Well, it's about time the Council noticed...but you just made a huge mistake, chasing after us.", "2373": "Stop wasting time. Leave them to the spirits and let's leave this place.", "2374": "But it's so much more fun to take care of business ourselves…heh.", "2375": "Don't make me say it again. We've got the relic and we're leaving this place before they catch us.", "2376": "Relic?!", "2377": "Unfortunately, your lives are now up to the ruins.", "2378": "Go and get rid of those intruders!", "2379": "Ahh, the spirits!", "2380": "Farewell, then. Have a good time with the spirits. Haha!", "2381": "Finally, they're asleep. I can't believe those guys could control the spirits of the ruins!", "2382": "Could it be the power of the relic they stole?", "2383": "We lost them, but everything makes a lot more sense now. Let's tell Lycana about this.", "2401": "We got a reply from Lycana. I wonder if the Council found any leads on them.", "2402": "I'll read the message.", "2403": "Just as we suspected, it was the Dark Magicians behind all of this.", "2404": "The Council was on the job right after we got the message, but couldn't find any trace of them.", "2405": "The Council was shocked to hear that they used the relic to control the spirits of the ruins.", "2406": "Right now, we're looking for their next target and what kind of relic they stole.", "2407": "We thank you for your cooperation. You have been a tremendous help.", "2408": "The Council has sent a handsome reward as a symbol of their gratitude.", "2409": "You can check in the Challenge on the bottom.", "2410": "I'll contact you again when there's progress. Thank you.", "2411": "This has spiraled out of control!", "2412": "Who knew the relic could grant them with the power to control the spirits?", "2413": "We need to catch them now!", "2501": "Have you heard?", "2502": "Kellan is in the Arena!", "2503": "He was the most ruthless fighter in the Magic War... I get goosebumps just thinking of him.", "2504": "He's never lost a match. He's up to 23 consecutive wins now.", "2505": "Because no summoner dares to challenge him now, he's visiting them one by one.", "2506": "That means he'll get to us one day!", "2507": "…I trust you'll be okay, but it's Kellan we're talking about here!", "2508": "The competition's heating up in the Arena. All the prominent Magicians are gathering one by one.", "2509": "Every match now is do or die.", "2601": "Curses! Let's get rid of these monsters quick!", "2602": "We need to hurry up! They're probably there already.", "2603": "We can't be late this time.", "2604": "Fire spirits! The ruins must be awake. Damn it!", "2605": "I think those guys are still in here. Let's hurry and catch them!", "2606": "We've finally reached the lowest level! I think we've still got a chance to catch them.", "2607": "They're probably around somewhere. Don't let your guard down.", "2608": "We've got the last relic.", "2609": "Yes. Now there's only the summoning left.", "2610": "We could have done this on our own.", "2611": "Perhaps I'm a bit sentimental. I wanted come to see the last piece.", "2612": "Let's move, Sir Elheil.", "2613": "Well...", "2614": "Sir?", "2615": "I think we have some guests.", "2616": "Guests?", "2617": "It's you again!", "2618": "You...you're still alive?!", "2619": "You know these two?", "2620": "So...sorry, Sir. They were at the Hydeni Ruins...", "2621": "You won't be able to run away this time! Give back the relic!", "2622": "I underestimated them…I thought the spirits would take care of them.", "2623": "I apologize. It's my fault.", "2624": "No, it means they're skilled enough to survive.", "2625": "You the one in charge? What kind of evil plan are you plotting?", "2626": "Shut your mouth! Sir Elheil, allow me to take care of this.", "2627": "I think the Council caught onto us faster than we expected. We must leave this place and let him do his job.", "2628": "It's a shame such talent has to go to waste. I'll leave them up to you.", "2629": "Yes, Sir. I'll make sure to get the job done this time.", "2630": "Stop right there! Where do you think you're going!", "2631": "You two are dead meat!", "2632": "What are you trying to do with the relic? What are you going to summon?", "2633": "Hmph! Why would I tell you? You're going to die soon anyway.", "2634": "I'll show you the meaning of fear!", "2635": "Ugh...! Impossible!", "2636": "Now tell me what you're up to!", "2637": "You're far too late. I'm done here, but he will…", "2638": "He will destroy the Council and establish a new order.", "2639": "What are you summoning with the relic?! Where are the others heading to?", "2640": "Hahah... You'll find out.", "2641": "Hey! Hey!", "2642": "I think he's gone.", "2643": "Durand!", "2644": "Looks like we got here too late.", "2645": "Lycana.", "2646": "I'm sorry it took us so long to get here. What happened to the relic? Did you find it?", "2647": "The Dark Magicians took the relic and got away.", "2648": "Their boss's name was Elheil.", "2649": "Elheil Lohenheim…", "2650": "Hmm? You know him?", "2651": "He was big around here. People hailed him as a genius. It's a long story.", "2652": "So he's the one who did it... Did he say anything about a summoning?", "2653": "Yes. He talked about a summoning, but we didn't catch where.", "2654": "He's up to something.", "2655": "What do you mean? Do you know anything about it?", "2656": "I'm guessing...", "2657": "Well, let's not jump to conclusions. We need to search this place thoroughly.", "2658": "I'm terribly sorry for all this trouble.", "2659": "It's nothing. We really need to find more evidence.", "2660": "Our highest priority would be finding their traces. We need to hurry up.", "2661": "Lycana, let's start searching.", "2662": "Got it.", "2701": "A message from the Council. Did they find out where the Dark Magicians were headed to?", "2702": "I'll open it.", "2703": "I truly wanted to thank you for your work this time. We wouldn't have gotten this far if it weren't for you.", "2704": "Since it's urgent, I'll cut to the chase.", "2705": "The Dark Magicians are trying to summon monsters from another world.", "2706": "What? Monsters from another world? How is that possible?", "2707": "It's happened before, when the Portal to Another World was open…due to a mistake on the ancient peoples' part.", "2708": "That's just... impossible.", "2709": "Makes no sense, right? I can't believe it either.", "2710": "So that's the purpose of the ancient relics they stole. The question is, where are they headed to?", "2711": "Lycana and I narrowed it down to a few places.", "2712": "However, it's still a lot of places... and we don't have enough men.", "2713": "I'd like you to search one of our findings.", "2714": "I'm sorry to ask you for a favor, but we're really in a dire situation.", "2715": "Go to the Faimon Volcano, then contact us as soon as you get there.", "2716": "This isn't something you can handle by yourself.", "2717": "We're in crisis mode now.", "2718": "I hope luck's on our side. Take care of yourselves.", "2719": "An attack on the Council and now monsters from another world? This is madness!", "2720": "I really can't believe this is happening! Tell me it isn't real!", "2801": "There's a lot of Fire monsters in this area because they live in the volcano. Phew, I can feel the heat already!", "2802": "That was exhausting.", "2803": "All this heat combined with having to fight the ferocious monsters...", "2804": "No sign of any summonings, though.", "2805": "Hmm... Should we keep looking though?", "2806": "Wait! Those monsters don't look like they're from around here.", "2807": "So we meet again.", "2808": "Hey, it's you!", "2809": "I never dreamed we'd see each other again after Vrofagus.", "2810": "But you managed to find this place. I'm impressed.", "2811": "Is this...your summoning place?", "2812": "All this talking isn't going to get us anywhere, now is it? Let's end it here.", "2813": "Ugh... you're pretty strong. Never saw this coming...", "2814": "But... you won't stand a chance against Sir Elheil...", "2815": "I've alerted Durand so the Council should be here soon. They'll bring you to justice!", "2816": "You know nothing! You'd understand if only you knew the real reason…", "2817": "Why are you doing this? You know you can't control otherworldly monsters!", "2818": "It was all done in the spirit of adventure…and progressive magic is about taking risks.", "2819": "You know there's a line you can't cross! You're only going to repeat the mistakes of the ancient people!", "2820": "Thump! Thud!", "2821": "Haha.. Do you hear that?... Finally, the beginning of a new chapter…", "2822": "…I finally fulfilled my purpose. Sir Elheil, please…", "2823": "Ahh! It's begun! But Durand's still not here!", "2824": "Looks like we're on our own!", "2825": "Wait, what are those?", "2826": "Are those..the otherworldly monsters? That means the summoning was...", "2827": "There's someone lying on the ground!", "2828": "Hey, hey! Wake up!", "2829": "Oh no... He's dead. Was this the monster's doing?", "2830": "But wait a minute. He's wearing the same black outfit as Elheil's men!", "2831": "There must have been a problem after the summoning. They couldn't control the power!", "2832": "We could really use Durand right about now.", "2833": "Those otherworldly monsters are everywhere! And they've left a trail of destruction in their wake.", "2834": "They're a lot stronger than the ones we dealt with. Careful!", "2835": "It's just endless... What do we do? Is this the end of our journey?", "2836": "You both are a mess.", "2837": "Oh, Durand!", "2838": "Sorry we're so late. Good to see both of you.", "2839": "You're just in time! We were about to give up!", "2840": "Apologies. We tried our best, but there were monsters everywhere.", "2841": "This is devastating. Looks like the summoning is already over.", "2842": "So... He really did it. Elheil, that fool...", "2843": "What do we do now?", "2844": "There's only one thing to do. The same thing we did in the past.", "2845": "Yes. Whatever portal the summoning slipped through, it must be sealed.", "2846": "As soon as possible... otherwise, we'll have even more monsters on our hands.", "2847": "Oh no... We've got to stop them!", "2848": "No time to waste... Let's go!", "2849": "Whoaa! What's that?", "2850": "An otherworldly beast! How did Elheil...?", "2851": "Welcome. Durand, I see you brought some friends. Why didn't you come a little earlier?", "2852": "You could have saved a few more Magicians.", "2853": "It can't be…Tell me those summoners aren't dead!", "2854": "You're despicable. How could you do such a thing?", "2855": "Elheil, I've warned you about doing this!", "2856": "You know you can't control the monsters from another world!", "2857": "Don't get all worked up. It wasn't a complete failure.", "2858": "What? How can you say that? Look at what the beast did!", "2859": "That was before the power of the Mana Crystal was revealed. I can't say it was a complete success, but now I've seen the possibilities.", "2860": "This is not failure, but just the beginning.", "2861": "That's all in your head. You gambled our world for this... And you're going to pay for it.", "2862": "That's right. I'm going to have to pay one day.", "2863": "But not today.", "2864": "I saw the possibilities and had to make a sacrifice. And now, I must go.", "2865": "Don't try to run away from this! Get him!", "2866": "I believe you have a more urgent problem to take care of.", "2867": "What?!", "2868": "Don't you have to do something about that otherworldly beast? You'll need to hurry up with the sealing.", "2869": "Hey! That's your responsibility!", "2870": "Guess I'll catch you later.", "2871": "Stop right there!", "2872": "Ahhh! Careful, the beast is charging towards you!", "2873": "We have to do something before another portal opens! We've got to seal it right now!", "2874": "Ugh... Damn it!!", "2875": "Can you buy me some time and deal with the beast? I need to prepare the sealing magic!", "2876": "Stall him as much as you can! We're going to start sealing!", "2877": "Phew, the seal was successful!", "2878": "Are we safe now?", "2879": "Yes, as long as the seal is strong enough.", "2880": "That's a relief. I'm glad we're all safe and sound.", "2881": "Although we lost Elheil...", "2882": "It makes me so angry just thinking about him!", "2883": "He got away with the relic, but it won't be easy for him to do anything like this again.", "2884": "He lost all his men and he'd need a lot more Mana Crystals for another summoning.", "2885": "That's true, but he's so unpredictable.", "2886": "But for now, I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work.", "2887": "Especially you... I don't know how to express my gratitude.", "2888": "You did something amazing. You saved our world.", "2889": "Hey, I was the first to know the Summoner would be the one to save us. Haha!", "2890": "I can't imagine how things would have turned out without you.", "2891": "I promise you, there will be a big reward from the Council.", "2892": "But for now..", "2893": "We'll have to clean up this place and track down Elheil.", "2894": "We must also search for survivors.", "2895": "That's right.", "2896": "Let's split up and start the search!", "3001": "A message from Durand. I wonder how they're faring.", "3002": "I'll open it.", "3003": "Hey, friend! How's the search?", "3004": "Are you fully recovered? Feeling better?", "3005": "Well, you did battle an otherworldly monster. I don't blame you for being tired.", "3006": "It's so hectic here. I think it'll take a while for everything to settle down.", "3007": "I'm just letting you know. There's not much happening here.", "3008": "And Elheil...just disappeared.", "3009": "We can't find any traces of him.", "3010": "The Council wants to track him down, but I don't think they'll find him unless he comes to them.", "3011": "Lycana is busy taking care of all the weird things that are happening.", "3012": "Maybe you've already reached a message for help.", "3013": "Weird things have been happening all over the world. I'm guessing it's because of the exposure of another world.", "3014": "Did you know? You've become a huge hero here.", "3015": "People want to invite you to become a member of the Council and even the Magic Society!", "3016": "I'm so proud to have you as a friend!", "3017": "Listen, I've told you many times…", "3018": "Whether you like it or not, the world needs you.", "3019": "This isn't the end. Actually... it's just the beginning.", "3020": "There's tons of Magicians waiting to battle you in the Arena!", "3021": "You're a rockstar!", "3022": "Check your Inbox. I've sent you a gift to show you my appreciation.", "3023": "I'll talk to you again, my friend.", "3024": "He's right, the world needs you!", "3025": "I'm so honored to be working alongside you!", "3026": "So... Arena again?", "3027": "Gah, when do we ever get to rest?", "3201": "You know that you get different Runes in different areas, right?", "3202": "I hear that you can get the General Rune in Mt. Siz! It's made up of 4 pieces.", "3203": "The Rune is supposed to increase your Attack Power.\nI can't wait to see it with my own eyes!", "3301": "Yes! We finally got the whole set!\nIt wasn't easy getting all 4 pieces.", "3302": "But you look stronger already!\nYou did great.", "3303": "I think we need to start paying attention to Rune Power-ups now.", "3304": "Powering-up your Runes is a must to become stronger than ever.", "3305": "Why don't we give it a try?\nI'm sure it'll come in handy during battles, too.", "3501": "Let's use the 2nd Energy Rune you got from the last battle.", "3502": "You'll be able to get the Energy Rune's set effect right away!", "3503": "It worked! Now we have 2 sets of the Energy Rune!", "3504": "Oh! Did you know that you can get different Runes from different areas?", "3505": "For example, you can get the Energy Rune from the Garen Forest and you'll get a different piece in each stage.", "3506": "I can't believe we have to clear every stage...", "3507": "But at least we know now, right?", "3508": "What? You're going to get rid of the Rune already? We should at least complete the whole set first!", "3601": "Huh? Who's this message from?", "3602": "Hi! Hello!\nIt's Shai here!", "3603": "Oh, it's you.", "3604": "I'm participating in the Arena, too!\nI can't wait to fight against you.", "3605": "Getting nervous?\nWell, you should be!", "3606": "You better bring some strong monsters this time!\nI want a challenge!", "3607": "Well, I'll be waiting for you!\nBye! Haha!", "3608": "I don't know what to say.", "3609": "Don't worry about it.", "3701": "Oh, it's a message from Durand.\nWhat could this be about?", "3702": "How are you doing, my friend?\nI'm sure you're doing fine... for now.", "3703": "I'm sending you this message to inform you of some news.", "3704": "There's a new challenger in the Arena named Kian.", "3705": "No one knows where he came from, and his face is always hidden from view.", "3706": "He's a mysterious monster with incredible power.", "3707": "He's basically raking in all the Crystals in the Arena.", "3708": "So what do you think?\nThink you can take him on?", "3709": "He's a serious threat to your place in the Arena.", "3710": "I'll be waiting for the great match.", "3711": "But you should be prepared.\nHe's not an ordinary opponent.", "3712": "I wonder who he is...\nAnd he's taking all the Crystals?", "3713": "We need to do something.\nThis is serious!", "3801": "Another message from Lycana! I think we could use a vacation.", "3802": "I'll open it now.", "3803": "It's me, Lycana. \nI'm sorry to be contacting you again like this.", "3804": "I'm sure you heard from Durand, but strange things \nhave been happening all over the place these days.", "3805": "I guess this comes as no surprise, since we were exposed to a great amount of energy from the other world.", "3806": "We're doing our best but we need your help again.", "3807": "I heard zombies have been appearing in Aiden Forest\nlocated north of Faimon Volcano.", "3808": "Aiden Forest was a territory owned by the Ferun Kingdom \nand areas nearby are now being called the land of death.", "3809": "Nothing there survived.", "3810": "There were always rumors about Aiden Forest, but... I don't think it's just rumors this time.", "3811": "I'll send more information to Ellia. \nThanks in advance for everything.", "3812": "I'll keep in touch.", "3813": "I know a bit about Aiden Forest and the Ferun Castle. \nPeople have seen ghosts from there.", "3814": "Do we have to go? \nI know they're just rumors, but...", "3815": "I feel like you'll somehow bring all of them out.", "3816": "Oh, what am I talking about...", "3851": "Huh? Look at the monsters!", "3852": "What did I tell you! Huh?", "3853": "I knew this would happen. \nI guess they weren't just rumors, after all!", "3854": "According to Lycana's last message, \nno one was able to find anything here.", "3855": "Where did these monsters come from?", "3856": "But why does this happen all the time?\nIsn't it weird?", "3857": "Why does this always happen when you're around?\nTell me!", "3858": "So many monsters...\nAnd it's so eerie in here.", "3859": "I have a bad feeling about this place...\nI'm going to tell everyone about it!", "3860": "The battles are getting harder.\nThese monsters seem a little different, too.", "3861": "I just... get this bad feeling.\nIt's like they don't have souls.", "3862": "They do look like zombies, don't they?", "3863": "And we're surrounded by monsters.\nThe bad energy is getting stronger, too.", "3864": "I don't get what's happening here.", "3865": "Huh? That's...\nPlease be careful!", "3866": "Watch out!", "3867": "Whew... That was close!\nWhat do you think that was?", "3868": "But it's weird...\nThe bad energy isn't going away.", "3869": "Maybe there's something else.\nWhere is this energy coming from?", "3870": "Oh! Do you see that?\nThe Ferun Castle!", "3871": "This dark energy...\nI think it's coming from there.", "3872": "I think we need to take a look.\nLet's tell Lycana first.", "3901": "We got a message from Lycana.\nI'm sure it's a reply for our last message about Aiden Forest.", "3902": "I'll read it now.", "3903": "Hi, it's Lycana. \nI guess the rumors were true.", "3904": "I think Ferun Castle needs to be checked out.\nThe Ferun Castle was always shrouded in mystery.", "3905": "Everything just disappeared all at once\nand that's all we know about the place.", "3906": "Some say the last king made a mistake\nwhile using some kind of magic...", "3907": "They say it's all because of a curse,\nand others say they've all been moved to another dimension...", "3908": "No one knows for sure.\nAll we know is that it's a dark and spooky place.", "3909": "I guess I'll have to ask you to look around.\nBut please do hurry.", "3910": "We... actually have a serious problem.\nWell...", "3911": "I'm sure you know about the Portal to Another World.", "3912": "The ancient seal that was blocking the Portal to Another World\nhas become quite unstable these days.", "3913": "And it's getting worse day by day.", "3914": "Everything that's happening right now...\nI'm sure it's related to otherworldly summonings.", "3915": "We've concluded that the best thing to do for now\nis to find the cause of all this.", "3916": "Durand is working very hard to find the cause\nbut it's not enough.", "3917": "We're all eager to figure it out.", "3918": "I'll be counting on you.\nPlease hurry!", "3919": "No! The Portal to Another World?\nThis is serious!", "3920": "I thought the seal would be good enough\nbut I guess not...", "3921": "We're going to need to hurry!\nLet's leave now.", "3951": "I knew it.\nThe dark energy was coming out from the Ferun Castle.", "3952": "I'm sure we'll be able to find where this is coming from\ninside the castle. Let's hurry!", "3953": "This castle is so creepy...\nBut isn't it weird?", "3954": "These monsters...\nThey look like they used to protect this castle.", "3955": "Hmm...\nLet's hope not.", "3956": "Do you feel it, too?\nThe dark energy is getting stronger.", "3957": "These monsters are really weird...\nThey don't look alive.", "3958": "Huh? Did you feel that?\nI got goosebumps!", "3959": "There's something at the end of this path.\nI can feel it.", "3960": "Ahh!\nThe energy was coming out from here!", "3961": "I feel like I'm shivering.\nWhat is this energy?", "3962": "Please be careful.\nThere's something else inside it.", "3963": "Huh? What...\nWhat's that black rock?", "3964": "I don't even want to look at it!\nThat rock was the source of the dark energy.", "3965": "I can't believe no one was able to find this.", "3966": "This whole place is full of questions.\nLet's contact Lycana now.", "4001": "We have a message from Durand.\nMaybe he found out what the black rock is!", "4002": "I'll read it now.", "4003": "My friend! Thanks for your hard work.\nYou found a great clue this time again.", "4004": "Don't be surprised, \nbut the rock you found is...", "4005": "A piece of the Kagor Magic Stone.\nIt was used to open the Portal to Another World in the ancient times.", "4006": "Huh?\nHow can that be?", "4007": "Wasn't the Kagor Magic Stone shattered\nwhen the Portal was sealed?", "4008": "We all believed the stone had lost its powers,\nbut we were wrong.", "4009": "I'm guessing the stone responded to the energy\nfrom Another World when it was exposed.", "4010": "The magic stone has regained its power.", "4011": "Weird things have been happening near Faimon\nwhich is where the magic stone pieces are shattered around.", "4012": "Lycana is working on purifying the stone\nand the Council is working hard to find all of the pieces.", "4013": "I'm sure you heard about the seal on the Portal to Another world.\nWe really need to hurry.", "4014": "I'm sorry to ask so much of you,\nbut we need your help.", "4015": "Please go to Mt. Runar located east of Ferun.", "4016": "I hear the monsters have gone crazy\nand I'm guessing it's because of the magic stone.", "4017": "We need to purify the stones as soon as possible,\nbut there are just so many of them.", "4018": "I have faith in you.\nI'll contact you when we find out more.", "4019": "This is crazy!\nThe magic stone has regained its powers?", "4020": "I guess we're lucky to have found it early enough.\nBut this is really getting serious.", "4021": "We have no time to waste now.\nLet's hurry and find the pieces!", "4022": "Shall we go?", "4051": "This energy again...\nI'm sure this place is contaminated by the magic stone.", "4052": "Let's try to find it as soon as possible!", "4053": "Whew... This cave is like a maze.\nI hope we don't get lost.", "4054": "The energy is getting stronger.\nLet's go this way.", "4055": "We need to hurry.", "4056": "Huh? This feeling...\nThere's something over there!", "4057": "I'm sure the magic stone is here somewhere.\nBut this feeling... I really can't get used to it.", "4058": "Ahhh! Dragon?\nBut what does it...", "4059": "I think it's been contaminated by the magic stone!\nBe careful!", "4060": "It was the magic stone!\nI can't believe it contaminated the dragon, too!", "4061": "Who would create such a thing?\nI just don't understand...", "4062": "I guess we should take it back for now.", "4063": "Let's leave before other monsters get contaminated.", "4101": "It's a message from Lycana.\nI hope she's doing okay.", "4102": "I'll open the message.", "4103": "Hi, it's Lycana. \nThank you so much for everything.", "4104": "The magic stones are being purified\nand the Portal is also becoming more stable.", "4105": "Durand is a great leader so I'm sure we'll be able to \nfind all of the pieces in no time.", "4106": "We only have a few more to find, but...\nWe need your help to find them.", "4107": "It's a place called Charuka Remains\nand something else has been happening here.", "4108": "All of the researchers had to leave Charuka\nbecause something caused the monsters to go mad.", "4109": "They all say they witnessed a giant monster\nthey've never seen before.", "4110": "I'm guessing something else is the cause of all this.\nAnd that thing is probably contaminated by the magic stone.", "4111": "Since we need to find the pieces as fast as we can,\nthere was no better person to ask than you.", "4112": "Everyone at the Council agreed that you two are the best fit for the job.", "4113": "And I agree with them.\nThe Charuka Remains is a very important site for all researchers.", "4114": "I know I'm asking a lot of you\nbut please find the magic stone and the giant.", "4115": "It's good to hear from her.\nI'm so glad the Portal is stabilizing now.", "4116": "But the giant monster...\nI'm getting kind of scared.", "4117": "I'm sure you'll be fine, though!\nEveryone's counting on you!", "4118": "Let's get going now!", "4151": "Hmm... The monsters have taken over Charuka.\nAnd I can tell the magic stone is here.", "4152": "Okay. Ready to go?", "4153": "Hmm. I don't see the giant yet.\nI don't feel the dark energy, either.", "4154": "I can tell it's not going to be easy.", "4155": "Weird. This place is different from all the other places.\nThe dark energy is fading away, too.", "4156": "Maybe we're not on the right track.", "4157": "I think this is the end of Charuka.\nI don't feel anything!", "4158": "We're going to reach the sea soon.\nMaybe we came the wrong way.", "4159": "Huh?

What's that?", "4165": "That light...\nIs that... the Portal?", "4166": "The stone has been altered...\nand the Portal has opened...", "4167": "What's going on here?", "4168": "We need to tell Lycana now!", "4169": "Everything about this place is just... not right!", "4201": "It's a message from Durand.\nI hope they found something", "4202": "from the research they conducted on Charuka Remains.\nI'll read it now.", "4203": "How are you, my friend?\nI thought you'd want to hear from me.", "4204": "I've been really busy\ntrying to figure out all the madness.", "4205": "Where should I start...\nHmm...", "4206": "There's good news, bad news,\nand more good news.", "4207": "First off, all of the magic stones have been purified.", "4208": "We couldn't have done it without you.\nBut this has actually caused the bad news.", "4209": "The Portal has become unstable again.", "4210": "We failed in stabilizing it,\nand the seal is on the verge of breaking.", "4211": "We're going to need to find a way to fix it\nbefore it completely breaks apart.", "4212": "And the last bit of good news is...\nYou won't be able to guess.", "4213": "I think there's still hope for us.", "4214": "The Portal you found is the Portal to the ancient civilization.", "4215": "But that's not all.\nThe power of the ancient civilization is able to purify the magic stones!", "4216": "I guess the magic stone woke up the ancient gatekeeper\nby accident.", "4217": "Isn't it crazy?\nYou couldn't make this stuff up!", "4218": "That's all I have for now.", "4219": "Lycana has left for Charuka for more research.", "4220": "But we did it!\nYou're really a great summoner.", "4221": "The Council is preparing a reward for your hard work.\nWe'll never be able to repay for what you've done, though.", "4222": "Thanks for everything, my friend.\nI can't thank you enough.", "4223": "I'm really proud to be your friend,\nyou know that?

Thank you so much!", "4230": "The portal at Charuka... And the Portal to Another World... We need to dig deeper...", "4231": "I guess it'll work out fine. This won't be the end of the story, right? Haha!", "4232": "Lycana is working as hard as she can. I suppose she will be contacting you soon.", "4301": "Hmm? Lycana sent us a message.

I was taught that they became one with nature...Why are they back?", "4412": "Our guess is that the recent incidents with the frequent opening of Dimensional Rifts ended up waking them up.", "4413": "That's not our biggest problem. The Rift of Worlds is submerging.", "4414": "It's getting unstable day by day. If this continues...", "4415": "There's no way to put this nicely. The seal is going to break in a matter of time.", "4416": "What? Do you mean it's going to open up?", "4417": "The Council of Summoners is dealing with this matter under the command of Durand.", "4418": "They are there...to prepare for the worst, rather than to prevent anything from happening.", "4419": "No...How can this be?", "4420": "The council will soon be declaring this to be an official threat to this world, and ask for the help of all Summoners.", "4421": "I've reached out for you two to ask for your assistance in a much more urgent matter. To deal with the Primal Giants.", "4422": "Primal Giants are the ones that have existed since the earth took its first breath. It is impossible to eliminate their existence.", "4423": "However, it is possible to send them back to nature. But this is just a temporary solution.", "4424": "This isn't going to be easy. But with the help of other Summoners, it's not impossible.", "4425": "You must be confused with all of this happening at once. We are too. But now's the time we need your help more than ever.", "4426": "We need all of the help we can get. I'll get back to you if anything changes.", "4427": "I don't know what to say...There's too much to process. I must stay calm...", "4428": "So, I guess we're going to fight the Primal Giant.", "4429": "I trust you to make it through anything...But this time...", "4501": "That was an immense battle. Now I understand why they were once known as the rulers of this world.", "4502": "But I never thought of taking so many Monsters into a battle at once. That was brilliant!", "4503": "(Rumbling sound)", "4504": "Wh..What was that?", "4505": "(Rumbling sound)", "4506": "Is this...?!Can this be...???", "4507": "(Intense rumbling sound)", "4508": "That was a powerful surge of power...", "4509": "An urgent message from Durand!", "4510": "(Static) Ca...You...ear...(Static)...I...", "4511": "Come as soo..(Static)..as you get thi...(Static) Come...the Rift of Worlds...(Static)", "4512": "The seal...(Static)...broken...(Static)", "4513": "We still ha...hope..(Static)...managed to...rotect a seal...", "4514": "(Intense static)", "4515": "We've lost him! Could something have happened to Durand?", "4516": "No, he must be fine. It must be the Rift of Worlds interfering with our communication.", "4517": "I think he said we still have hope.", "4518": "We must hurry. Let's go to the Rift of Worlds!", "4601": "My friend...", "4602": "You've made it.", "4603": "Durand! Lycana! You're both okay! Thank the gods!", "4604": "The energy coming from the rift is messing up our communication. The Council of Summoners is alright.", "4605": "That's a relief. But this place...", "4606": "Yes, if hell existed on earth...It would be here.", "4607": "But we made it through the first part. So let's calm down and prepare for the next.", "4608": "What do you mean? I thought I heard you say there was still hope.", "4609": "We should be glad that we're still able to stand here. Do you see that sealing stone over there?", "4610": "Oh! One is still intact!", "4611": "Yes, we failed to prevent the rift from opening, but we did manage to protect that seal.", "4612": "How did you manage to...?", "4613": "Durand saw that it was impossible to protect all of the seals, so he sent out the order to focus all strength to protect one seal only.", "4614": "That's how we were able to protect that one. We're still focusing a lot of our strength to keep it that way.", "4615": "So, the rift did open, but I guess it's safe to say that we managed to prevent it from fully opening.", "4616": "I'm impressed with myself right now. I think I was born for moments like this.", "4617": "You...are unbelievable, Durand...", "4618": "......", "4619": "......", "4620": "*Clears throat* Anyways, I believe it's safe to say that we've avoided the worst-case scenario.", "4621": "Now, we must maintain the seal's stability while dealing with the creatures that come through the rift.", "4622": "We've solved one problem, but there are still many more to deal with. The biggest issue being the broken central seal.", "4623": "You mean that thing in the middle of the rift?", "4624": "Yes, the outer seals are also broken, but there are still no signs of special activity.", "4625": "But that one is different. A very dangerous thing has appeared.", "4626": "This beast is... different from what we've seen. I have faith in you, my friend, but you will not be able to deal with it alone.", "4627": "You will need to cooperate with the best Summoners to take the beast down.", "4628": "A party of Summoners? What exactly are we dealing with? Are you sure that a party of Summoners is all that is needed?", "4629": "We've requested all Summoners to help maintain this line of defense.", "4630": "I believe that you two will be most helpful.", "4631": "Of course. Whatever you need. Right?", "4632": "I'm sorry to ask you to do the impossible again. Beware my friend, this will be the toughest battle you've fought.", "4633": "And...", "4634": "I've done my job, so it's time to do yours. Haha!", "4635": "Durand...", "4636": "I've been at your service for years, but still I find it difficult to get used to you.", "4637": "Haha, it's a joke! Just to light things up!", "4638": "This isn't a good time for jokes...", "4639": "Don't give up on hope! We've been through a lot! Don't you remember?", "4640": "Enough talking. It's time we get down to business.", "4641": "The Council of Summoners will provide anything you need.", "4642": "I'm ready!", "4701": "A tough battle for even 3 Summoners…\nIt's a powerful Monster.", "4702": "You're right. We would've never made it if it weren't for the help of other Summoners.", "4703": "More and more Summoners are coming to help us from all over the world, so don't get your hopes down!", "4704": "Durand! Durand!\nIt's urgent!", "4705": "Lycana, what's going on?", "4706": "It seems that the seal has been broken and the new beasts that have never been seen before have appeared!", "4707": "What?!", "4708": "Oh, no! \nJust when I thought we were safe…", "4709": "Shoot!\nThis was only the beginning.", "4710": "The thing is that the beasts possess different attributes.", "4711": "I believe the beasts have combined with our world's elements and have come to possess a special ability.", "4712": "Is that why they've been holding back even after the seal has been broken?", "4713": "Does that mean that they have become even more powerful?!", "4714": "Let's calm down…\nWe must protect the last seal no matter what.", "4715": "Let's bring together all the help we can get.\nI'll inform the Council of Summoners and try to come up with a plan.", "4716": "The situation doesn't look good. \nWe better come up with a special plan.", "4717": "Until then, all we can do is to find out as much information as we can while blocking the beasts.", "4718": "I'll prepare the investigation team right away.\nAnd…", "4719": "You need someone to deal with the beasts while investigating.\nWe got you covered.", "4720": "Thanks.\nI'm lucky to have you guys around.", "4721": "Okay! Don't get your hopes down!\nLet's hurry and do what we can do!", "4801": "Wow, that was intense! I'm not sure how long we can keep up with these beasts.", "4802": "But you still survived all the attacks!\nI'm really impressed.", "4803": "Everyone, I can't thank you enough.", "4804": "Durand,\nWe're on our way back from the investigation.", "4805": "I guess it's more accurate to say \"trip to hell\" than \"investigation\".\nOh, Lycana! How was the investigation?", "4806": "There are things that still need to be figured out,\nBut I've got some news.", "4807": "I hope it's good news.", "4808": "As we expected, the beasts have combined with our world's elements and have come to possess attributes.", "4809": "Does that mean that they have Evolved?", "4810": "Yes. They've come to acquire a powerful, dangerous ability with the power of combined elements.", "4811": "That's what I thought.\nBut, they seemed pretty unstable to me.", "4812": "Right. I found out that their power is currently at an extremely unstable state due to the sudden change.", "4813": "And it has created a critical weakness.", "4814": "A weakness? What is it?", "4815": "It's a very obvious one.", "4816": "Is it…\nThe attribute relations?", "4817": "Correct.\nThe beasts have come to possess a great power with the attributes,", "4818": "but the attribute relations have also created a critical weakness in them.", "4819": "Hmm…Using the attribute relations.", "4820": "By the way, any news from the Council of Summoners?", "4821": "Oh, I almost forgot.\nThe Council of Summoners is doing the best they can do.", "4822": "They're calling out all of the Summoners for help and gathering resources for the battle.", "4823": "…and due to the seriousness of the matter,\nThey've come to take extreme measures.", "4824": "What do you mean?", "4825": "They're allowing the use of Homunculus.", "4826": "Are you serious?", "4827": "No way! Who would suggest such a dangerous idea?", "4828": "I agree. Although we're in a critical situation,\nUsing Homunculus is too risky. That's why it's been banned…", "4829": "… I suggested it.", "4830": "Durand, you did?!", "4831": "Durand, this can make the situation even worse.\nHaving a full control over the Homunculus is impossible.", "4832": "You should know better…", "4833": "Let's calm down.\nThe most important thing is to protect our world.", "4834": "How long do you think we can protect the last seal with the power of our own?", "4835": "Right now, we must protect this world using everything we've got. Even if that means borrowing the power of Homunculus...", "4836": "But, what if Homunculus gets out of control?", "4837": "There should be a proper process to allow the use of Homunculus and restrictions to prevent possible risks.", "4838": "A skilled Summoner has a better control over the Homunculus. However, I still…", "4839": "Let's talk in private on this matter in the future.", "4840": "I think my friend needs to get some rest, first.", "4841": "Oh, are you okay?", "4842": "My apologies. I totally forgot.\nYou two should go back and get some rest.", "4843": "Yes. I've never seen you so exhausted before.", "4844": "I'll contact you later about the Homunculus, again.\nGet some rest until then.", "4845": "I hope you guys make a wise decision.", "4846": "I promise I will.", "4901": "Are you alright?\nIt's already been 2 days since you fell asleep.", "4902": "You look rested now.\nI was afraid that you might not wake up.", "4903": "Durand contacted me while you were asleep.\nIt seems that the use of Homunculus has been officially allowed.", "4904": "Only the approved Summoners will have access to the Homunculus, and there are a lot of restrictions to prevent any possible risks.", "4905": "I understand why they made such a decision,", "4906": "but I'm still worried.\nOh, and….", "4907": "You're allowed to use the Homunculus, already.\nI expected you'd have an access since you're one of the best Summoners.", "4908": "You're going to summon the Homunculus even if it's risky, right?", "4909": "I won't say anything. I'll just follow your decision.", "4910": "But, promise me you'll be careful!", "5001": "Hmm? \nThere's a new message from the Magic Society.", "5002": "Let's open it up now.", "5003": "Hi,\nthis is Reina!", "5004": "I assume you already know who I am.", "5005": "Reina, what's going on?", "5006": "Hey, Ellia!\nI heard you got transferred to a newbie!", "5007": "Huh? Reina! What are you saying…?", "5008": "Please be patient with her.\nShe's rather unique... haha.", "5009": "I feel bad for you, Ellia.", "5010": "Well, I guess I'm not the one to say that.", "5011": "Are you listening, newbie? \nYes, I'm talking about you!", "5012": "Reina, please!", "5013": "Let's cut to the chase.", "5014": "Durand sent me here to take care of you,\nso I'll be your teacher for a while.", "5015": "What?!", "5016": "If it weren't for Durand,\nI wouldn't be here.", "5017": "You better thank me for this!", "5018": "I'm not sure what's going on...", "5019": "Well, I'm not sure if you're smart enough to follow my lead but let's test it out.", "5020": "I have an assignment for you, so check the Challenge now.", "5021": "A test? A Challenge?", "5022": "I need to see if you're qualified to be my pupil.", "5023": "Monster training is the basics of a Summoner. Complete the missions that I listed, first!", "5024": "I left some special tips as well, so I expect some results!", "5025": "Though I don't believe that Durand sent me here for nothing...", "5026": "Anyways, this is all I have for you.\nGood luck!", "5027": "I'll check the rest once the assignment is complete.\nBye!", "5028": "……….", "5029": "You must be frustrated \nbut you know who she is, right?", "5030": "Despite her age, she became the youngest Advanced Summoner in the Magic Society...", "5031": "Although, she's rather famous for her unexpected behaviors...", "5032": "I think Durand wanted to help, but I'm not sure why she became the resolution...", "5033": "She has a unique personality, but there's no doubt in her talent.", "5034": "We should take a look at the assignments, by the way.", "5101": "Oh!\nIt's a message from Reina.", "5102": "Let's see what she says.", "5103": "Hey! You!", "5104": "Uh-oh...", "5105": "I heard you're pretty good for a beginner!\nI'm impressed!", "5106": "Don't get too excited, though!\nAlways remember how much I helped you out.", "5107": "Hahaha.", "5108": "Anyways, it seems that you're following my lead pretty well.", "5109": "So, I've decided to give you a new tip on the next step.", "5110": "Wait, there's more?", "5111": "It's called, \"Fast Leveling Strategy\"!", "5112": "It should actually be called \"super-fast\", but I'll settle with \"fast\" for now.", "5113": "What a funny... title!", "5114": "It's much harder than the previous guide, so get ready!", "5115": "Let's begin!", "5201": "There's a message from the Magic Society!\nWould it be Reina...?", "5202": "This is so annoying!", "5203": "Yes, it's her.", "5204": "I heard you guys went to the Cairos Dungeon?", "5205": "Yes... but why do you ask?", "5206": "Why do I have to teach the newbie about the Cairos Dungeon?!", "5207": "It looks like Durand asked her a favor again.", "5208": "Be thankful that I'm giving you all these special tips.", "5209": "(Tips that we never asked for...)", "5210": "I've got no time to waste, so let's get right into it!", "5211": "Okay...", "5301": "There's a message and I'm reluctant to open it...", "5302": "Summoner, it's a message from Reina!\nWe should open it, right...?", "5303": "You... guys!", "5304": "!?!?!?", "5305": "You're going up against the Giant in the Cairos Dungeon!?\nAre you insane?", "5306": "…..", "5307": "Thanks to you two, I'm here again! \nCan you please just stay in the Sky Island?", "5308": "We'd love to...", "5309": "I understand...\nI need to share my ability with others for the greater good.", "5310": "……", "5311": "Okay, I'll help you guys once more.", "5312": "You really don't have to...", "5313": "Let us begin!", "5314": "I've already sent the materials, so check the Challenge.", "5315": "……", "5401": "There's a new message.\nReina?\nWhat's is going on?", "5402": "Hey!\nI heard you built a Fusion Hexagram!\nDo you even know what it's for?", "5403": "Oh that, I was going to explain it just now...", "5404": "I knew it. What would you do when I'm gone? Do I really have to explain to you all these details one by one?", "5405": "Umm... \nThat's why I was going to do the explanation... \nSo you can just relax...", "5406": "This is so annoying!\nYou know how busy I am?\nI'm only doing this for Durand.", "5407": "Umm... \nOnce again, we never asked for help if you remember...", "5408": "Whatever. \nIt's a waste of time to just stand here and talk.\nJust follow me! I'm busy!", "5409": "*Sigh* I don't think she's listening.", "5410": "But, her guide will be a great help, so let's follow her for now.", "5501": "Hmm? There's a new message!\nIt's Reina again. \nShe still has something to say, I guess...?", "5502": "YOU!", "5503": "Uh-uh. I think she's mad...?", "5504": "You conquered B10 of Giant's Keep?!Are you out of your mind?", "5505": "Wait, weren't you the one who told us to go to Giant's Keep B10?", "5506": "You didn't believe in our Summoner, did you?", "5507": "I just... didn't think our newbie would be able to carry out the mission. I admit that you've grown a little stronger now. I'll call you a \"new one\" instead of newbie from now on.", "5508": "Uh... Okay. \nWhat's the difference between... the two?", "5509": "Don't you get it? A newbie is someone totally new who I don't have any respect for, but a \"new one\" is someone who I acknowledge as a Summoner who can take care of oneself!", "5510": "Don't you think you should pick a better name...?", "5511": "Nope. Our \"new one\" still has a long way to go to earn my respect. You! Get yourself together and follow my lead! \nIt's not going to be easy!", "5600": "Yes!\nI believe we can defeat them if we fight as a team.", "5601": "By the way, where is Lycana?\nIs she helping other Summoners?", "5602": "Lycana? Oh, actually...\nShe has um, another secret mission to complete.", "5603": "Secret mission?", "5604": "It's somewhat related to you as well.", "5605": "Us?\n...Durand, I don't like where this is going.", "5606": "Hahaha!\nDon't be too suspicious.", "5607": "Ugh... But whenever you call us in, \nsomething BIG happens...", "5608": "Hmm, that's true.\nHahahaha!", "5609": "It's not funny!", "5610": "Hey, don't blame everything on me.\nThink of it as... Yes, a destiny of heroes!", "5611": "Whatever...", "5612": "Hahaha- Since you just ended a big battle,\nwhy don't you go back and take some rest for now?", "5613": "Will do.\nI'm worried about our Summoner's condition.", "5614": "It's important to maintain a good condition!\nI will call you once everything is ready, so get some rest.", "5615": "Please take your time, A LOT OF TIME\nbefore calling us. Please.", "5616": "Hey, my friend!\nYou're here!", "5617": "Huh?!?! Durand?!?!\nWhy are you here?", "5618": "Hahahaha-\nI was waiting for you.", "5619": "Waiting? What?\nBut you said...", "5620": "The Sky Island is such a wonderful place.\nIsn't it?", "5621": "…………", "5622": "It's not easy being a Hero.\nRight?", "5623": "…………\n…Durand…", "5624": "Hmm, I guess everything is set by now.\nWe should get going.", "5625": "…Set???\n...Get going???", "5626": "Haha, seeing is believing!\nWe should talk more after you see it for yourself.", "5627": "What do I have to see now?\n...I say this all the time, but you just can't show up and...", "5628": "I will say this now- this is strictly confidential.\nAnd you will experience something beyond your imagination.", "5629": "Ugh...

That was a great fight.", "50202": "Now that the Arena competition has begun, we need to build up our Defense.", "50203": "Let's place monsters to defend the Arena from the Summoner's Tower.", "50301": "The Arena Defense has been placed. I think you made the right choices.", "50302": "Wait, there's one more thing! The Arcane Tower can support the Defense area in the Arena.", "50303": "Adding the Arcane Tower on top of Defense placement will really beef up your Defense!", "50401": "Wait, there's one more thing! The Arcane Tower can support the Defense area in the Arena.", "50402": "It takes a while to recharge the tower but once it's charged, it'll destroy all of the enemies.", "50403": "Your defense will be stronger than ever if you add Arcane Towers to your defense line.", "50501": "Ah! The impenetrable Arcane Tower. Our enemies will have a hard time attacking us.", "50502": "Build more Arcane Towers for iron defense!", "50601": "You're so famous now! The merchants from the Trade Association have been trying to get in contact with you.", "50602": "They heard there was a rookie in the Arena and want to sell you magic items.", "50603": "How about building a Magic Shop to start trading? You can find some good stuff!", "50701": "The Magic Shop is complete! Now we can trade with merchants.", "50702": "Looks like the merchants have already arrived. I wonder what kind of items they brought. Let's go check!", "50801": "Have you heard of the Temple of Wishes?

But it's worth a try!", "50803": "A Goddess' blessing can be your best bet in the Arena.", "50901": "Oh, great Goddess Ameria! Can you feel her gentle presence?", "50902": "Let's try to visit at least once a day and make a wish. She just might hear our prayers!", "51301": "You Powered-up a Rune! The upgraded Rune will make the monster stronger.", "51302": "Monsters can't live without Runes!\nWe're going to have to Power-up other Runes, too!", "51601": "Areas like the Pond of Mana and Summonhenge perform specific actions...", "51602": "...but relics can have positive effects just by being placed.", "51603": "For example, Magic Rocks and Mana Fountains increase Mana production speed.", "51604": "Buying relics to speed up Mana production will definitely prepare you for the Arena!", "51701": "I see you've placed relics. I can feel the energy already!", "51702": "I'd stock up on as much as I could if I had the money, but they're so pricy!", "51703": "Let's try to collect them one by one!", "51801": "This place has really come into its own! We need more space than ever for buildings.", "51802": "How about we summon a new island? I think it's time to upgrade!", "51901": "The island's so much bigger!", "51902": "There's so much room for activities!", "51903": "You're the best!", "52001": "Have you heard of a forest that makes monsters stronger?\nMonsters in Tranquil Forest are said to level up automatically!", "52002": "It's another way to strengthen your monsters. Isn't it great?", "52003": "What are you waiting for?\nLet's build the Tranquil Forest and level up our monsters!", "52101": "The Tranquil Forest is complete!\nI can't believe this forest possesses such immense power.", "52102": "It's time to level up now!", "52201": "You can purchase powerful relics with the Glory Points you earned in the Arena at the Glory Shop!", "52202": "You can strengthen your monsters or increase storage or efficiency.", "52203": "Why don't we get a relic with our Glory Points? How about a sanctum of energy to start off?", "52301": "Wow! The sanctum of energy gave us extra Energy!", "52302": "The Glory Shop is full of useful items!", "52401": "Mana Crystals are the most valuable resources of our time.", "52402": "I know you're gathering as much as you can, but it's not enough. We should try constructing our own Crystal Mine.", "52403": "I know it's not going to make a big difference, but it's better than nothing!", "52501": "The Crystal Mine is complete! We'll be making extra Mana Crystals now!", "52502": "We're going to have to wait for it, but it's worth the wait.", "52601": "The relics from the Glory Shop can be upgraded to become more powerful!", "52602": "Let's try upgrading the sanctum of energy that we got last time.", "52603": "We'll be able to get more Energy!", "52701": "Great! Extra Energy! It's time for more battles!", "52702": "We're going to have to save up the Glory Points for another upgrade! So much to do!", "52801": "We need more Mana Stones! The Pond of Mana isn't going to be enough.", "52802": "How about we construct the Ancient Runestones for extra Mana Stones?", "52803": "It should help with our Mana Stone shortage since it's known to be more powerful than the Pond of Mana!", "52901": "Wow! It's huge!", "52902": "We won't have to worry about Mana Stones for a while now!", "53001": "Can you show me your summoning magic again? We have enough Scrolls and I love watching you!", "53002": "Ready to summon?", "53003": "Whew! That was tough! We're going to have to strengthen our monsters. There's nothing better than Power-ups when it comes to strengthening monsters!", "53004": "Power-up now?", "53005": "What? There were monsters without Runes! Runes are the easiest way to make your monsters stronger.", "53006": "Let's go engrave Runes!", "53007": "The set effect of Runes can help us a lot in battles. I think %s's %s Rune Set is almost complete.", "53008": "Engrave Runes now?", "53009": "Ready to go get some Runes?", "53010": "How about Powering-up %s's %s Rune? It'll strengthen the monster instantly with some Mana Stones.", "53011": "Power-up the Rune now?", "53101": "You got Awakening materials! Awakening is the best way to bring out the monster's true power!", "53102": "Monsters also get a brand new look! I think it's time to Awaken the monsters!", "53103": "Awaken now?", "53201": "Wow! We found a Secret Dungeon! This must be our lucky day!", "53202": "You can get summoning pieces in Secret Dungeons to summon monsters!", "53203": "This is great! We should tell all of our friends about it! I wonder who we'll meet this time.", "53204": "Enter the Secret Dungeon now?", "53301": "Wow! It's the very first summoning piece!", "53302": "You can summon the monster in the Summonhenge when you collect all of the pieces!", "53303": "Go check now?", "53401": "Have you heard of the Trial of Ascension?", "53402": "It has been said that for a long time, many summoners have tested their limits at the Trial of Ascension.", "53403": "Why don't you give it a try?", "53404": "It won't be easy, but this will be a good opportunity to know your limits and get stronger.", "53501": "I think we've gotten pretty strong now!\nHow about we try out the Trial of Ascension in Hard Mode?", "53601": "Have you heard about the new Transmogrification? I heard you can change your Monster's looks!", "53602": "How about we build a Transmogrification Building and try it out?", "53701": "The Transmogrification Building is complete! Now we can change the looks of our Monsters!", "53702": "You can acquire Shapeshifting Stones, used for Transmogrification, from the Cairos Dungeon and the Rift of Worlds!", "53801": "You got Rune Enchantment materials! Rune Enchantment allows you to Convert or Amplify Runes!", "53802": "Would you like to check it out now?", "53803": "I can't wait to see how strong the Monsters will become through Enchantment!", "53901": "The Council of Summoners has authorized the construction of Fusion Hexagram!", "53902": "I knew you'd be authorized right away despite the Council's high standard!", "53903": "You can now summon even more powerful Monsters by Fusing the Monsters! Let's try building the Fusion Hexagram now!", "53911": "So many Monsters to choose from! I can't wait!", "53912": "I'm sure the Monster will be of a great help to you since it's a very powerful one!", "54001": "You can Craft buildings, Runes, and various items at the Craft Building.", "54002": "The Rune Craft will be especially useful at times like this since you need to strengthen your Monsters.", "54003": "Shall we start Crafting now?", "54011": "The Craft Building has been installed! You're going to need a lot of materials for Crafting...", "54012": "Make sure to collect the materials from now on!", "54101": "You've collected quite a few Monsters now. Let me help you manage them more efficiently! Try installing the Monster Storage.", "54102": "Make sure to install the Monster Storage ahead of time to manage the Monsters wisely!", "54111": "Wow! The Monster Storage is bigger than I thought! You can now summon as many Monsters as you want!", "54201": "Try to teleport through the Gateway.", "54202": "Summoner! \nHave you heard of a teleport?", "54203": "It's known that if you teleport through the Gateway,\nyou can transcend time and space and reach to the places in the blink of an eye.", "54204": "Transcending time and space?
